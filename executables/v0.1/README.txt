Thank you for downloading SimpleGlossary!
Using the program:
	~To run the program, double click the file SimpleGlossary.jar inside of this directory.
	~The program will automatically load up and display a blank screen to you.
	~When adding or removing a term, there is a button allowing you to insert special characters. This button opens a separate dialog and allows you to select a special character. It also has an option to make a character a 'favorite'. When you favorite a character, it is automatically saved to your settings in the file sconfig~, also in this directory. To reset your favorites to default, you can delete this file. 
	~Files can be exported as text files if you want a static copy that's easier to read, or if you want to put the data in some other document. 
	~If you encounter an error, please run the file DEBUG.bat and try to reproduce your error, then check to see if the program outputs anything in the console.
